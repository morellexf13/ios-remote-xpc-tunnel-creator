### üôãüèºWhy?

Starting at iOS 17.0, Apple refactored a lot in the way iOS devices communicate with the macOS. Up until iOS 16, The communication was TCP based (using the help of usbmuxd for USB devices) with TLS (for making sure only trusted peers are able to connect). You can read more about the old protocol in this article:

https://jon-gabilondo-angulo-7635.medium.com/understanding-usbmux-and-the-ios-lockdown-service-7f2a1dfd07ae

The new protocol stack relies on QUIC+RemoteXPC which should reduce much of the communication overhead in general - allowing faster and more stable connections, especially over WiFi.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-requisites

Python 3

Install requirements

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### ü¶∫ Build

1- Create binary with ```pyinstaller main.py --name remote-xpc-tunnel```

### üöÄ Usable args

```bash
--udid # device serial
--log-destination-path # location to write output files
--list-remote-devices # just obtain connected devices, do not create tunnels
```

### üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run

List remote devices

Give root permissions (needed) [pymobiledevice3 issues#562](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3/issues/562#issuecomment-1724226316)

```bash
cd dist/remote-xpc-tunnel
sudo chown root ./remote-xpc-tunnel
sudo chmod u+s ./remote-xpc-tunnel
```
(‚ö†Ô∏è These permissions are not enough to create a tunnel)

```bash
./remote-xpc-tunnel --list-remote-devices true
```

Create tunnel

1- Create a `remote-xpc-tunnel.scpt` file inside `dist/remote-xpc-tunnel` with the following content:

```bash
do shell script "./remote-xpc-tunnel --udid YOUR DEVICE SERIAL ID --log-destination-path YOUR PATH/rsd.json" with prompt "This script is about to create an iOS connection tunnel" with administrator privileges
```

2- Run applescript

```bash
osascript ./remote-xpc-tunnel.scpt
```
